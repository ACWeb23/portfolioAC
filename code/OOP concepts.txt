OOP concepts
Encapsulation:
combining properties(varibles) and behaviors(functions) together. AKA Class

Information Hiding:
attempting the user form using a class in the wrong way
for example preventing access to base varibles in the main function and allowing those varibles to be accesed through functions to control how they are used.
