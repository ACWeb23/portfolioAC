Inside the Zip file is the Masm 6.15 Assembler and Linker and 3 sample programs… prog1.asm, prog2.asm prog3.asm. Please unzip the files  in a folder of your choice. Test the Assembler and Linker by using the    make32.bat   file.

In DOS, give the following commands:
C:\Make32 prog1       to assemble and link prog1.asm

Run the program using the following command:
C:\> prog1

Let me know if you have any problems.
